To access: pull from Git and build as a JAR. There is also a direct download of the JAR at https://jeffery179.github.io/

This project is a simple blackjack game with a GUI. There is an option for the player to click for "help," 
which shows the player which move (standing or hitting) provides the more favorable outcome. After the black jack game is over,
a running total of wins, losses, and draws are kept. To play another hand, select "Deal Cards".

The blackjack game:

The dealer stands on soft 17. 
The player only has the decision to stand or hit. There is no option for splitting or doubling-down.
There is no betting, instead win, loss, and push totals will be kept.

The implementation:

The "book" for the blackjack game is stored in a 2D Array. 

A GUI made with Java swing was created. 
JButtons, JLabels, and JPanels were used to construct the GUI.
