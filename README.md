BlackJack Data Miner

*this project is still a work in progress*

The purpose of this project is to provide a user with their results from playing black jack. 
The user will play the traditional game of black jack and at the end of the game will be able to view their wins, losses, and draws 
in CSV format. In addition, the user will see how they did with each hand and whether they "went by the book" or not and how they ended up doing.

To Play: currently it is a console based text game. In the upcoming iterations of this project, a GUI will be provided.
