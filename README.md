BlackJack Helper

This project is a simple blackjack game with a GUI. There is an option for the player to click for "help," which shows the player which move (standing or hitting) provides the more favorable outcome.

The blackjack game:

The dealer stands on soft 17. 
The player only has the decision to stand or hit. There is no option for splitting or doubling-down.
There is no betting, instead win, loss, and push totals will be kept.

The implementation:
The "book" for the blackjack game is stored in a 2D Array. 
A GUI made with Java swing was created. Simple JButtons, JLabels, and JPanels were used to construct the GUI.
