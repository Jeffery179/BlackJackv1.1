BlackJack Data Miner

*this project is still a work in progress*

The purpose of this project is to provide a user with their results from playing black jack. 
The user will play the traditional game of black jack versus the dealer with standing/hitting as the only options and at the end of the game, the user will be able to view their wins, losses, and draws in CSV format. 

In addition, the user will see how they did with each hand and whether they "went by the book" or not and how they ended up doing.

A GUI made with Java swing was created. Simple JButtons, JLabels, and JPanels were used to construct the GUI.
